# OASIS-API
The core OASIS (Open Advanced Sensory Imersion System) API that powers Our World and manages the central profile/avatar/karma system that other satellite apps/games plug into it and share. This also includes HoloNET that allows .NET to talk to Holochain, which is where the profile/avatar is stored on a private decentralised, distributed network. This will be gifted forward to the Holochain community along with the HoloUnity3D SDK/Lib/Asset coming soon... ;-)

## HoloNET

If there is demand for HoloNET and people wish to contribuite we may consider splitting it out into it's own repo...

## HoloOASIS

HoloOASIS uses HoloNET to implement a Storage Provider for the OASIS System.

## .NET HDK

We will soon also begin work on the .NET HDK to open up the amazing Holochain to the massive .NET & Unity ecosystem's, which will help turbocharge the holochain ecosystem they are trying to build...

## Next Steps

1. Add HTTP support to HoloNET.
2. Add built-in HC Conductor to HoloNET so it can fire up it's own conductor without needing to do this manually.
3. Add a ZomeProxyGenerator tool so it can auto-generate a C# Zome Proxy that wraps around HoloNET calls (the code would be similar to what is in HoloOASIS)
4. Contuine with Unity integration and development of HoloUnity, which will then also be gifted forward to the wonderful holochain community... :)
