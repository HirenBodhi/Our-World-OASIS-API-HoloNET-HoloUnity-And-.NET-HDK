# OASIS-API
The core OASIS (Open Advanced Sensory Immersion System) API that powers Our World and manages the central profile/avatar/karma system that other satellite apps/games plug into it and share. This also includes HoloNET that allows .NET to talk to Holochain, which is where the profile/avatar is stored on a private decentralised, distributed network. This will be gifted forward to the Holochain community along with the HoloUnity3D SDK/Lib coming soon... ;-)
