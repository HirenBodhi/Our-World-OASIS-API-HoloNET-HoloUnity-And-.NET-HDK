# OASIS-API
The core OASIS (Open Advanced Sensory Imersion System) API that powers Our World and manages the central profile/avatar/karma system that other satellite apps/games plug into it and share. This also includes HoloNET that allows .NET to talk to Holochain, which is where the profile/avatar is stored on a private decentralised, distributed network. This will be gifted forward to the Holochain community along with the HoloUnity3D SDK/Lib/Asset coming soon... ;-)

## HoloNET

If there is demand for HoloNET and people wish to contribuite we may consider splitting it out into it's own repo...

## HoloOASIS

HoloOASIS uses HoloNET to implement a Storage Provider for the OASIS System.

## .NET HDK

We will soon also begin work on the .NET HDK to open up the amazing Holochain to the massive .NET & Unity ecosystem's, which will help turbocharge the holochain ecosystem they are trying to build...

## Next Steps

1. Add HTTP support to HoloNET.
2. Add built-in HC Conductor to HoloNET so it can fire up it's own conductor without needing to do this manually.
3. Add a ZomeProxyGenerator tool so it can auto-generate a C# Zome Proxy that wraps around HoloNET calls (the code would be similar to what is in HoloOASIS)
4. Contuine with Unity integration and development of HoloUnity, which will then also be gifted forward to the wonderful holochain community... :)

## Donations Welcome! :)

We are working full-time on this project so we have no other income so if you value it, we would really appreciate a donation to our crowd funding page below:

https://www.gofundme.com/f/ourworldthegame

Every little helps, even if you can only manage £1 it can still help make all the difference! Thank you! :)

We would really appreciate if you could donate anything you can afford, even if it's just a pound, if everyone did that then we would be able to massively accelerate this very urgent and important project for a world in need right now. I think everyone can justify a pound if it meant saving the world don't you think? 

It's even better to spend a pound on this project rather than buying a lottery ticket since you have more chance of being hit by a car than winning the jackpot, then even by some fluke you did win, there is no point having millions if there is no world left to enjoy it on. 

Think about it...

If you can't afford to contribute, then that's fine, you can still help by getting the word out there!
